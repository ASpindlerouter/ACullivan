    <bold>This is one of the several characters in the game that is based off real life people. Being an identical look-alike to Arnold Schwarzenegger and referencing some of Arnolds' popular movies, this character had to make the list. In order to unlock him, you first need to complete the 20 Coffee Breaks spread throughout the open world.</bold>

    alt="Man Has A Cone For A Head" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Even though you'd set your Robber disguise at the end of the game to Rex Fury, Carlo here is still funny to run around as. While he's the same as the other Robber disguises ability-wise, he does have a cone covering his head, just like the enemies in level 11. To unlock this disguise, paint the 3 balloons in Cresent Park yellow with the color gun. After this, go to a disguise booth, and rack up a measly 10,000 studs.</bold>

    alt="Being Those Who Made This City" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Yes, there is more than one creator, this was just the easiest to find. While you try to get 100% completion, you will pick up a couple of character tokens, which are Legofied versions of the creators. To name a few, there is Luke Cashmore, Mike Northeast, Rob Shepard, Louise Andrew, Sarah Horner, and Lauren Colclough. These are also some of the cheapest characters to unlock, costing 10,000 studs or less.</bold>

    alt="Man Wearing Gorilla Suit" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Being one of the 2 characters in the game to wear a animal outfit, Gorilla Suit Guy made the list, but tests your timing with button presses. To unlock this banana-bearing man, simply complete the 9 basketball mini-games in Festival Square. Afterwards, he charges a investment of 10,000 studs.</bold>

    alt="Man Wearing Lizard Suit" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Want to run around the world as a mini Godzilla? Then this is your character! To unlock this humanized reptile, blow the Lego store door in the Bright Lights Plaza district, and build 3 Lego sets. Then, get 10,000 studs, and you have a monstrous man to play with.</bold>
