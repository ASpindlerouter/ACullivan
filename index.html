    <bold>This is one of the several characters in the game that is based off real life people. Being an identical look-alike to Arnold Schwarzenegger and referencing some of Arnolds' popular movies, this character had to make the list. In order to unlock him, you first need to complete the 20 Coffee Breaks spread throughout the open world.</bold>

    class="cone"
    ><b><br>9. Carlo Cone</b></p>

    alt="Man Has A Cone For A Head" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Even though you'd set your Robber disguise at the end of the game to Rex Fury, Carlo here is still funny to run around as. While he's the same as the other Robber disguises ability-wise, he does have a cone covering his head, just like the enemies in level 11. To unlock this disguise, paint the 3 balloons in Cresent Park yellow with the color gun. After this, go to a disguise booth, and rack up a measly 10,000 studs.</bold>

    class="creators"
    ><b><br>8. The Creators</b></p>

    alt="Being Those Who Made This City" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Yes, there is more than one creator, this was just the easiest to find. While you try to get 100% completion, you will pick up a couple of character tokens, which are Legofied versions of the creators. To name a few, there is Luke Cashmore, Mike Northeast, Rob Shepard, Louise Andrew, Sarah Horner, and Lauren Colclough. These are also some of the cheapest characters to unlock, costing 10,000 studs or less.</bold>

    class="gorilla"
    ><b><br>7. Gorilla Suit Guy</b></p>

    class="fourth_image"
    src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMjelI-WQAkMswT.png"
    alt="Man Wearing Gorilla Suit" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Being one of the 2 characters in the game to wear a animal outfit, Gorilla Suit Guy made the list, but tests your timing with button presses. To unlock this banana-bearing man, simply complete the 9 basketball mini-games in Festival Square. Afterwards, he charges a investment of 10,000 studs.</bold>

    class="lizard"
    ><b><br>6. Lizard Man</b></p>

    alt="Man Wearing Lizard Suit" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Want to run around the world as a mini Godzilla? Then this is your character! To unlock this humanized reptile, blow the Lego store door in the Bright Lights Plaza district, and build 3 Lego sets. Then, get 10,000 studs, and you have a monstrous man to play with.</bold>
    <p
    class="disco"
    ><b><br>5. Disco Dude</b></p>

    class="sixth_image"
    src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Swm2ngXZQfM/sddefault.jpg"
    alt="Elvis Presley?" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>While I wanted him to look more like Jackson, what we got is still funny. This guy is also the statue in the Bright Lights Plaza. To unlock him, head up to the upper level of the center of the Bright Lights center and scale up the right side until you hit a teleporter. Use it, and you should collect him when you touch the disco ball of the disco dude.</bold>

    class="baseball"
    ><b><br>4. Baseball Player</b></p>
    <img

    alt="Boston Red Sox Outfit With Dodgers-Like Logo" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Ever wanted to have 2 baseball teams in one, like the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers! Well, now you can, with the Baseball Player! To unlock him, find the Cherry Tree Hills free run token, then complete the free run, which isn't to difficult if you know the path.</bold>
    <p
    class="cowboy"
    ><b><br>3. Cowboy & Bandit</b></p>
    <img
    class="eighth_page"
    src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3M2TXahgdX0/maxresdefault.jpg"
    alt="Your Personality As John Marston" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>Do you remember that in Red Dead Redemption, if you kill bandits, you're a cowboy and your honor goes up. If you kill the inoccent, you're a bandit and your honor goes down. That's why I'm placing both of these characters on the list. To unlock the cowboy, complete the free run in the Uptown district. To unlock the bandit, break the 18 ATMs in the open world with the Robber disguise.</bold>
    <p
    class="beach"
    ><b><br>2. Surfer, Surfer Girl & Lifeguard</b></p>
    <img
    class="ninth_page"
    src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZDpb5BUZmww/maxresdefault.jpg"
    alt="Anyone Remember Baywatch?" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>The reason that these 3 characters are all on the list together is because it just reminds me of the old show, Baywatch. To unlock the surfer, build the sand castle(30K required) in the Paradise Sands district, and grapple open the drawbridge with the Cop disguise. To unlock the surfer girl, paint 3 surfboards in the Paradise Sands district yellow. To unlock the lifeguard, paint 3 buoys at the docks of the Cresent Park district red.</bold>
    <p
    class="original"
    ><b><br>1. Chase McCain(Wii U) or Custom B(Remaster)</b></p>
    <img
    class="tenth_page"
    src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/legocityundercover/images/1/1d/Chase_McCain.jpg/revision/latest"
    alt="The Original" width="100%" height="100%">
    <bold>You and I both knew that the cover art and original version of Chase McCain was at the number 1 spot. While he's the 2nd character unlocked in the main story for the Wii U, his design was changed in the remaster. However, you can still find his original design in the game as Custom B. Just, don't customize it, because if you do, none of the pieces can be selected again.</bold>
